# Folder Organizer

A simple but highly effective tool that automatically organizes files into their respective folders based on file extensions. Select any directory, and the script will instantly arrange all files into well-structured folders.

## 🚀 Overview
This project helps in maintaining a tidy workspace by sorting files such as:
- `.py` files → **py/**
- `.cpp` files → **cpp/**
- `.json` files → **json/**
- `.PPT` files → **PPT/**
- `.png` files → **png/**
- `.exe` files → **exe/**
- Documents, images, audio, video, and more → Their dedicated folders

The logic behind the project is minimal yet powerful, built entirely on simple `if-else` conditions.
